# NorKEY-Mac
The Keyboard Layout for Norwegians coders and translators - Version for Mac OS X.
Norwegian version of [EurKEY-Mac](https://github.com/jonasdiemer/EurKEY-Mac)
It only includes Æ, Ø and Å of the special symbols in the original layout - making it less error prone to typos for Norwegian users.

Install
=======
Copy the two files `NorKEY.keylayout` and `NorKEY.icns` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred to ensure the layout is available to all applications. For the changes to take effect a restart is required.

How to use the Keyboard
=======
After the restart go to `System Settings` > `Keyboard` > `Edit` > `+` and search for `NorKEY v1.0`. After adding the layout select its symbol from the menu bar icon.
